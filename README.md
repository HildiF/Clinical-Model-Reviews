# Clinical Model Reviews #

This page provides a brief overview of what clinical model reviews are about in general as well as a brief introduction to the particular project / template or archetype you have been asked to review.

One of the key tenets of openEHR is to empower clinicians to create and maintain the clinical content of health care applications and systems. Clinical content is built from “archetypes” (granular computable re-usable models of clinical concepts) and “templates” (bringing together and adjusting component archetypes to represent a clinical document, message or data entry requirement).

Together these two “building blocks” are used to provide the technical implementers and developers with the required artefacts to write code and build applications and systems.

For a more detailed introduction to archetypes and templates, [this presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/secret/4s9HdIMKg0HyME/) may be useful.

Following the principles of “crowdsourcing”, the review process provides the means for interested clinicians, informaticians and any other stakeholders to give their views on the models and ensure they are as complete and fit for purpose as they can be.

The review is carried out online using the Clinical Knowledge Manager tool, and it is entirely up to the reviewer how much time they wish to spend.

There are a few resources which might be helpful, especially if you are new to this process:

For a great overview of the Clinical Knowledge Manager tool and the review process see [Dr Paul Miller's slideset](http://www.slideshare.net/openehr/introduction-to-openehr-clinical-knowledge-manager) prodcued for previous NHS Scotland medication and allergies reviews.
